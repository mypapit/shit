Ok so i seem to be developing this like a cow wandering across a field.

=State of play as of= 

*9th August.*
codefreeze on the server for Xpath1, Xpath2

_Xpath1_
Hardcoded with location of Arca results xml file and will output the following to screen

csv format

,trackname,drivername,Qualifying position,Race finish position,fastest race laptime,finishing status

_Xpath2_
you specify the name of the XML file to parse i.e. ./xpath2 pocono16jan09.xml and it out puts to screen the following

,trackname,drivername,Qualifying position,Race finish postition,fastest race laptime,finishing status,true/false did driver lead a lap,how many laps did driver lead for.

To Do List.
  # learn to poke some data from perl into mysql
  # learn to create empty database
  # poke into empty database the output of xpath2 by csv and SQL
  # create a date/track validator for poking data into the data base- lookup from the events table
  # chill

*9th August*

9.8.1
Steve has mentioned that joomla uses community builder for its integrated user logon and forum, so we will use that in the future

going to work on poking a line from the results file into the data base. i will use the line
{{{
,Prarie Meadows 250,Mike Morris,1,2,23.1395,Finished Normally,true,3
}}}
as the control line

i will use a database table called 9.8.1
