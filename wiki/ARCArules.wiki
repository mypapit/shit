  # Qualifying Points:  1st-15; 2nd-10; 3rd-5
  # 5 pts. awarded to any official lap leader.
  # 5 additional pts. awarded to leader of the most laps.



if $LapsLead>0 
then insert 5 into importer.LedaLapPoints
else
insert $LapsLead into importer.LedLaps.

then at the end of the importer there needs to be a query that finds the driver with the most led laps and insert 5 into importer.Ledmostlapspoints


add a coloum for each driver and give everyone 0 points and at the end have an insert query that changes the driver who led the most laps 5.

then when inserting for proper bring that across into their row

need something similar for the Qualifying, give everyone 0 points and have

if $qpos=3 insert 5 into $driver,5,qpos
loop

end up with
