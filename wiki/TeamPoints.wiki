Writeup on the team points.

this "module" is trickier than expected, but thats a good thing :)

here are the rules for the team module.


different series have different rules


a team can have 4 drivers
the top 2 scoring drivers points for the team go towards the teams total.

heres the tricky bit

should a driver leave a team then there points stay at that team

should a driver join a team there points from that moment are credited to the team.

so we need to read the memberships of the teams when looking at the results.

best way is to create a table that has the teams points in it and an entry after every schedule.

so i need to learn the following.

get the top 2 drivers from a team and push data into a table referencing schedule id driver id points and teamid
