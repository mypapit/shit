Ok so i seem to be developing this like a cow wandering across a field.

=State of play as of= 

*9th August.*
codefreeze on the server for Xpath1, Xpath2

_Xpath1_
Hardcoded with location of Arca results xml file and will output the following to screen

csv format

,trackname,drivername,Qualifying position,Race finish position,fastest race laptime,finishing status

_Xpath2_
you specify the name of the XML file to parse i.e. ./xpath2 pocono16jan09.xml and it out puts to screen the following

,trackname,drivername,Qualifying position,Race finish postition,fastest race laptime,finishing status,true/false did driver lead a lap,how many laps did driver lead for.

To Do List.
  # ~~learn to poke some data from perl into mysql~~ 9.8.1
  # learn to create empty database
  # poke into empty database the output of xpath2 by csv and SQL
  # create a date/track validator for poking data into the data base- lookup from the events table
  # chill

*9th August*

9.8.1
Steve has mentioned that joomla uses community builder for its integrated user logon and forum, so we will use that in the future

going to work on poking a line from the results file into the data base. i will use the line
{{{
,Prarie Meadows 250,Mike Morris,1,2,23.1395,Finished Normally,true,3
}}}
as the control line

i will use a database table called 9_8_1 to push the data into
the syntax for putting stuff into a mysql database is INSERT INTO people VALUES ('Euler', 'Leonhard', 248, NULL, 58, 'M')

so we need to find the perl equivlent and then add it to our xpath2 parser(then add error handling to see if the line already exists as we dont want to end up with duplicate entries by mistake)

CREATE table jwracing_jwracing.981 LIKE jwracing_jwracing.importer;
INSERT into jwracing_jwracing.981 SELECT * FROM jwracing_jwracing.importer;

./8911.pl  adds the line into the database
