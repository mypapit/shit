==Basic overview==

  # Take race results file
  # web interface to import file
  # Store on server for reference
  
  # qualify the data that is check its clean from invalid characters
  # cross reference the event to the schedule in the database
  # cross reference the drivers in the results file to drivers in database
  # Display example of data that will be entered, ie placing etc points, have an edit button
  # Insert data into database


as of 28th July We have the following
a perl script that will take the XML and output in csv format.
hardcoded filename, output has to be redirected out via >

manual import into mysql

==Next to create==

Looking at checking integraty of results.xml importing the data from results file into a newly created table and then running the user UI sanity checks before importing the data into the database.
  # create temp table with relevent fields
  # import the data into the table
  # display the data vi php
  # perform qualification of date/track


data that we want to be imported, and thusly needs to be extracted from the XML
For all Drivers
<RaceResults>
<TimeString>
<TrackEvent>
<GameVersion>
Per Driver
Driver name <Name>
Qual position <GridPos>
Finish position <Position>
Points <Points>
