Ok so i seem to be developing this like a cow wandering across a field.


= State of play as of = *9th August.*
codefreeze on the server for Xpath1, Xpath2

_Xpath1_
Hardcoded with location of Arca results xml file and will output the following to screen

csv format

,trackname,drivername,Qualifying position,Race finish postition,fastest race laptime,finishing status

_Xpath2_
you specify the name of the XML file to parse i.e. ./xpath2 pocono16jan09.xml and it out puts to screen the following

,trackname,drivername,Qualifying position,Race finish postition,fastest race laptime,finishing status,true/false did driver lead a lap,how many laps did driver lead for.

To Do List.

  # create a date/track validator for poking data into the data base- lookup from the events table
  # chill
